		<p>I am passionate about contributing to the development and growth of a brand--whether it be a company, product, service or person-- by focusing on the cultivation of and also the strategic decision-making and innovation that support the identity or "story" that represents and guides each project.</p>
		<p>Internally, identity-centric communication, infrastructure and operational strategy are crucial to aligning teams, resulting in greater cohesiveness and intrinsic motivation. This then facilitates success as the brand/identity is presented to potential partners, investors, consumers and the general public via superior messaging, marketing, product development and utilization of various opportunities at touchpoints with stakeholders to establish and to paint an authentic, clear picture of the brand's story. We must consider that on the whole, now more that ever, people connect more deeply with brands and will often align/identify with them, creating the opportunity to build a more profound sense of value and highlighting the need to hone in on identity and ways for it to create an impact.</p>
		<p>I have worked/work with several types of brands across industries, often considered to be startup/micro-cap "designation," typically in a high-growth and development transitional stage that leads into a new chapter and may include a launch of new products, pivoting to a shifted focus of expertise, seeking an IPO/preparing for VC presentations, planning for an acquisition/merger by/with another company and/or deploying a comprehensive reboot/refinement needed in its current growth stage. Often, I create and execute an overarching alignment goal project; assist in business plan/decks and websites so content and design reflect the brand's identity/goals; map strategies in operations, marketing, and creative branding/messaging and facilitate successful completion of these programs.</p>
